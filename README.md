The finite automaton equivalent to a regular expression. 
This is a project designed for the Formal and Automatic Languages course, written in C++ language,
according to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. The project consists of receiving any regular expression
and processing it step by step in order to create the equivalent finite automaton.
